# :postbox: About Me
My name is Elvin and I am a Computer Science student!

```java
public class Elvin
{
  private int age = 20;
  public String[] traits = new String[] { "sleepy", "hungry", "nerd" };
  public String[] hobbies = new String[] { "Coding!", "Fashion", "Gaming", "Sleeping" };
}

I have been interested in coding since I was in high school. I started off coding by creating Roblox games that had garnered thousands of players. Now I'm creating full-stack web and mobile applications and exploring AI/ML integrations!
